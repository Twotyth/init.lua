WIP to setup neovim for my liking (>.<)

## Plugins
  * [Lazy] - My plugin manager of choice (blazingly fast)
  * [Web dev icons] - Just better
  * [Telescope] - Fuzzy search
  * [Harpoon] - Quick navigation between chosen files
  * [Tint] - Visual window split / floating window focus
  * [Trouble] - Better diagnostics, quickfix, all the good stuff
  * [Tree sitter] - Required plugin to even work in neovim
  * [Mason] and [Mason-Lspconfig] - Configure and manage language servers easily
  * [Autopairs] - Insert paired characters and auto-manage tabulation on new line. Handy
  * [Flash] - New way to jump and select. I kinda like it

## Next goals
1. Fugitive (and git respectfully)
2. Maybe tabnine / codeium (?)
3. Figure out / setup some auto-build commands for c++ and c# (actively in pain when doing any C++ projects because of it)
